# Maximizing Revenue in Taxi Services through Payment Type Analysis 

## Problem Statement
In the dynamic taxi booking sector, optimizing revenue generation is vital. This study investigates whether different payment methods influence taxi fares, utilizing statistical analysis to potentially guide customers towards more profitable payment options without degrading the service quality.

## Objective
The primary aim of this project is to conduct an A/B test to analyze the correlation between total fares and payment methods. We use hypothesis testing and statistical analysis in Python to determine if there is a significant difference in fares associated with credit card payments versus cash payments.

## Research Question
Does the payment method correlate with the total fare amount? Can we encourage customers to use payment methods that potentially generate higher revenue for drivers without negatively impacting their experience?

## Test Used 
Hypothesis testing and Linear regression analysis

## Conclusion
The key business insight is that encouraging customers to pay with credit cards can generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers.
